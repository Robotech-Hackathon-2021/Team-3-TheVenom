## Problem statement
You have to create an all in one app where you can have complete smart services for
university-related cleanliness, lost & found canteen orders, event notifications etc. You
think standing in the queue for ordering food and then waiting for the food to get 
ready is wasting your time? It is the same problem for everyone. How about if you
could just order the food earlier(after the lectures/before reaching the canteen) and
the food gets ready before you get there. So you’ve found an earphone and not sure
where you’re supposed to report it? Found dirt in your classroom and don’t know the
appropriate authority to report? Could we just directly report this in the app and the
appropriate authority will take care of the situation. The application should be able to
handle all of the above-mentioned issues.

### Introduction

Here we can have complete smart services for university-related cleanliness, lost & found, 
canteen orders, event notifications, College News etc.
